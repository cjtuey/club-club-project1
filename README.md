# club-club-project1
Updated Friday, Oct. 2
The assignment for Club Club for the first half semester project. 

This repository is a QTCreator project, which can hopefully be easily imported into everyone else's IDEs if they're using the same one. Otherwise, using CMake from the command line could also work. If all else fails, you can build your own part of the project however you see fit, and I'll test it to make sure it still works when added to the CMake project. 

Each person has a .cpp file for their code. Ayoola has claimed ingredients.cpp, but the others are up for grabs. You can replace the [YOUR NAME HERE] in the comment with your actual name to claim your part. The stub functions are no longer needed, but they could still be useful as a test that Git is set up correctly. Just change them to say something else and try to update the main repository (instructions below). I'll need to add you as a collaborator first, so if you haven't already, make sure to send me your GitHub username or email. 

To contribute, you can use the Git command line tool to clone the repository, and commit and push when you want to update the main branch on GitHub. These command should work: "git clone https://github.com/cjtuey/club-club-project1", "git commit", and "git push". You can use "git pull" to get the latest updates from the main repository. I'm not very good with Git, so here's a tutorial to help if I've gotten anything wrong: https://github.com/git-guides. If you're using VSCode, you can use its built-in Git features instead. 

I'll try and get some decent skeleton code written soon to solidify what specifically each of us has to do, but for now, just try and commit something via Git to make sure it works. If you want to get as much of a head start as possible, you can consult the list of ideas from our second assignment submission and start working on implementing whichever part you've claimed. I can try to integrate whatever you come up with. 

If you have any questions, let me know. I'll update this README with anything useful I can think of. 

EDIT #1: I've created a set of utility functions for you to use in your part of the project. The documentation is in util.h, which will need to be included in your file with #include "util.h".
