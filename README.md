The assignment for Club Club for the first half semester project. 

This repository is a QTCreator project, which can hopefully be easily imported into everyone else's IDEs if they're using the same one. Otherwise, using CMake from the command line could also work. If all else fails, you can build your own part of the project however you see fit, and I'll test it to make sure it still works when added to the CMake project. 

Each person has a .cpp file for their code. Ayoola has claimed ingredients.cpp, but the others are up for grabs. You can replace the [YOUR NAME HERE] in the comment with your actual name to claim your part. For tomorrow's assignment, simply print something to the command line from the stub function included in your .cpp file, stating your name and any other information you want about your part of the project. It doesn't need to be long; that's what the text submission is for. 

The file "summary.txt" is our text submission. Feel free to add to it in any way you think will help it to better fulfill the assignment. At a minimum, we need to mention what we've done so far, whether we're using a top-down or agile approach, how the tasks have been divided, and our plans for completing the project. You can optionally include your name to indicate which parts you added, but I'll be sending the link to this repository to the professor as well, so he'll be able to tell who committed what. 

To contribute, you can use the Git command line tool to clone the repository, and commit and push when you want to update the main branch on GitHub. These command should work: "git clone https://github.com/cjtuey/club-club-project1", "git add [YOUR FILE]", "git commit", and "git push". I'm not very good with Git, so here's a tutorial to help if I've gotten anything wrong: https://github.com/git-guides. ([YOUR FILE] should be replaced with your part of the project, e.g. "ingredients.cpp").

If you have any questions, let me know. I'll update this README with anything useful I can think of. 

UPDATE #1: In order for me to merge your changes into main, I believe you need to make a pull request. This can be done through the GitHub website. I don't fully understand how any of this works, so we might need to experiment a little bit to figure it out.
